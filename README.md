This is a simple race game I made back in high school.

This game has a track and one car, the user can play with. The game counts laps and time and it also is capable of playing a background music (I removed the mp3 file because I had no copyright to the music I used in this game).

The main goal of this project was to learn PyGame and create something playable.
